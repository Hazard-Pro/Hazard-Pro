OK Hi I am Tom @Hazard-Pro and not a coder. I am a retired Earth Scientist -Geological Engineer who does pore pressure and 
rock properties analysis. I found the WebPlot Digitizer while browsing and thought it would be great for my research and 
project workflows. I have to gather a lot of data from public sources since I am an "independent consultant". 
I think it will be very usefull for gathering data points from public charts and graphs. I may also be able to digitize 
sections of well logs and covert them to LAS file format.
I can be found on LinkedIn.
